Student Score Prediction using Linear Regression
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict student exam scores based on the number of hours studied. The objective is to understand the relationship between study time and performance using supervised machine learning techniques.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

⚙️ Steps Performed

Loaded and explored the dataset

Defined input feature (study hours) and target variable (score)

Split data into training and testing sets

Trained a Linear Regression model

Evaluated performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score

Visualized the regression line and data points

📊 Results

The model successfully learned the linear relationship between study hours and exam score. Evaluation metrics indicate good predictive performance on test data.

🚀 Future Improvements

Add multiple features (attendance, sleep hours, etc.)

Implement Polynomial Regression

Compare with other regression algorithms
